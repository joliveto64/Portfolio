  //  - Maybe strings of words matching is better (eg query 'cats and dogs' matches 'cats and dogs' better than 'cats some more words dogs')?

  // Supplemental details on sorting:
  // Sorting is complicated. There are a million algorithms to do it, some better, some worse. This sort
  // function we use picks a good algorithm that's efficient. Regardless of what algorithm is used, the code
  // has no way to know how to compare two SearchResults. It doesn't know if you want to sort by title, or
  // by subtitle, or by description, or by poop. It doesn't know if you want to sort ascending or descending.
  // So, we pass in a callback (called a comparator) to do just that. It takes in 2 of the items to be sorted
  // and returns an integer that says which of the items is better: 0 means they're equal, negative means
  // searchResult1 is better, positive means searchResult2 is better.
